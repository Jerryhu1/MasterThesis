# MasterThesis

This repository contains the main code of my master thesis. 
EvoMusicCompnaion is a hybrid evolutionary algorithm that uses an n-gram model and an evolutionary algorithm to generate musical melodies.
The user must supply a transition matrix of both pitch and duration, which will subsequently be sampled to generate the initial population as well as the chord that that will be played. 

The `output` folder contains some output files which are `.mid` files, which are the actual music files, and `.csv` files, which were used for data analysis.
